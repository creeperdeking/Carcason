# Carcason

Carcason is a free video game adaptation of the board game Carcassonne. This is total plagiarism, no doubts about it, but this game is really funny, so having a freed video game about it could be interesting.

How to play:

To turn your tile: r
to put your tile: left mouse
to displace the camera: zsqd
to put a pawn (when you have put a tile):
	center: right_ctrl
	other side of the tile: arrowkeys
to end your turn: enter
to save the game: ctrl+s
