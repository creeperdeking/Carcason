# Carcason

Carcason is a free video game adaptation of the board game Carcassonne. This is total plagiarism, no doubts about it, but this game is really funny, so having a freed video game about it could be interesting.

How to play (French AZERTY keyboard):

SPACE: Turn your tile / end your turn
left mouse: put your tile
camera displacement: mouse on the screen's borders
Putting pawns:
	ZQSD : put a pawn on a city, a cloister or a road
	AEWC : put a pawn on a field
	Ctrl + ZQSDAZWC : the same, but put a big pawn instead
ctrl+s : save the game
ctrl+v : show vertices debug links
